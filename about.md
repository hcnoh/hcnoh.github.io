## About Me
I am an AI research engineer currently working in the AI Research of New Innovative R&D division of [Innodep](https://innodep.co.kr/renew/eng/). I am working for Innodep to advance their current smart monitoring solution and develop a new AI-based smart security platform.

I am familiar with probability and statistics, and I am also good at dealing with deep learning frameworks like PyTorch and TensorFlow.

My current research interests are information-theoretic approaches for deep learning modeling, computer vision for smart monitoring, and vision-language models for image information analysis.
